## A Reboot Version of JShell

The original version of JShell was extremely clunky code-wise, and was rather
difficult to progress on. I later made a new implementation, with a lot of
refactoring and organization, but it was delayed due to school work. I resumed
the project recently, but I wanted to start from scratch.
